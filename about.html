    <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed text-center">
      NobleCare Mobility was started by two best friends, inspired by the grandmothers who raised us
      with patience, kindness, and love. When they needed help getting to appointments, we realized
      how important respectful and reliable transportation is for families.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed text-center">
      We built NobleCare to honor them — and to make sure every passenger is treated with dignity,
      patience, and care. When we pick someone up, we treat them like family.
